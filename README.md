## Overview

This repository will contain all things related data structures & algorithm or competitive programming. I'll be using C++ because that's what I was taught in my highschool and hence have a good understanding of its fundamentals. Also, I follow CSES CP handbook and guess what, it recommends C++. 

__Why go through the trouble of learning DSA?__ Because apparently I need to master it or something to get a job.

Each folder has C++ codes for respective platforms/online judges. [template.cpp](https://github.com/SamIsTheFBI/dsa-sucks/blob/master/template.cpp) is how I usually tackle questions on Codeforces & Codechef. I hope to one day be brave enough to use Atcoder as well. For Leetcode, I just think too hard, write code [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) and put out many wrong submissions until it's accepted.
